Iâ€™m currently a PhD. Candidate at the [department of mathematics of Penn State University](http://www.math.psu.edu/) under the supervision of [Dr. Jinchao Xu](http://www.math.psu.edu/xu/). My research interest is robust and efficient iterative solvers for large scale linear systems raised from discretized PDEs. The method I am studying and investigating is based on auxiliary space preconditioning technique.
