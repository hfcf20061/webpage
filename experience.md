## Developer of FASP package (since 2014)
[FASP](http://fasp.sourceforge.net), short for Fast Auxiliary Space Precondition-
ing is an open-source software written in C which is aimed for developing mathematically
optimal iterative methods for solving discretized partial differential equations
(PDEs). It mainly utilizes the methodology of Auxiliary Space Preconditioning (ASP)
to construct efficient linear solvers.

## Developer of PennSim/ParPennSim software (since 2013)
PennSim is an oil and gas reservoir simulator developed for research purpose. 
It uses a general compositional formulation for the all the fluids and has included both black oil models and equation of state (EOS) compositional model. ParPennSim is a parallel reservoir simulator based on PennSim. In 2015,  ParPennSim was successfully implemented on the world’s No. 1 supercomputer (up to November 2015) [Tianhe-2](https://www.top500.org/lists/2015/11) to test several benchmark problems, which showed its robustness, efficiency and parallel scalability.[<img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.svg" alt="image"/>](https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-175602-MS)

## International Conference on Multigrid and Multiscale Methods in Computational Sciences, Bruchsal, Germany[<img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.svg" alt="image"/>](http://gcsc.uni-frankfurt.de/img2016)

**Presentation:** *A Unified Approach to the Construction of Coarse Spaces and Convergence Analysis in AMG*[<img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.svg" alt="image"/>](http://gcsc.uni-frankfurt.de/img2016/programme)

A general framework for the design and analysis of two-level AMG methods is presented. The approach is to find a basis for locally-the-best coarse space then glued them together using carefully designed linear extension maps to form a global coarse space. Such coarse spaces, constructed locally, satisfy global approximation property and by estimating the local Poincar&eacute; constants, we obtain sharp bounds on the convergence rate of the resulting two-level methods. To illustrate the use of the theoretical framework in practice, we prove the uniform convergence of the classical two level AMG method for finite element discretization of a jump coefficient problem and anisotropic problems on a shape regular mesh.


## 14th Copper Mountain Conference on Iterative Methods, Copper Mountain, Colorado, USA[<img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.svg" alt="image"/>](http://grandmaster.colorado.edu/~copper/2016/)

**Presentation:** *A Unified Theory for Classical and Aggregation Based AMG*[<img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.svg" alt="image"/>](http://grandmaster.colorado.edu/~copper/2016/abstract/zhang_hongxuan_096859/)

A unified convergence theory for both classical AMG and aggregation based AMG is developed. The coarse space in this theory is defined by the sum of locally low frequency spaces. As an application, the two-level uniform convergence of classical AMG and unsmoothed aggregation AMG for finite element discretized Poisson equation on a shape regular mesh is proved using this theory.

**Presentation:** *Algebraic Multigrid Method for Implicit Smoothed Particle Hydro-dynamics*[<img src="/images/Icon_External_Link.svg" alt="image"/>](http://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_talk.cfm?p=68015)

The aggregation based Alegebraic multigrid (AMG) method is generalized to solve the
large-scale linear system of equations discretized from implicit SPH. Auxiliary grid
approach is used to improve the efficiency and reduce the computational complexity.
