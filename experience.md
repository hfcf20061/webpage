## Developer of FASP package (since 2014)
[FASP](http://fasp.sourceforge.net), short for Fast Auxiliary Space Precondition-
ing is an open-source software written in C which is aimed for developing mathematically
optimal iterative methods for solving discretized partial differential equations
(PDEs). It mainly utilizes the methodology of Auxiliary Space Preconditioning (ASP)
to construct efficient linear solvers.

## [5th edition of SPE Reservoir Characterisation and Simulation Conference and Exhibition](http://www.spe.org/events/rcsc/2015/) 

<!--**Abu Dhabi, UAE, 09/14/2015-09/16/2015**-->

**ePoster Presentation:**  *[On Robust and Efficient Parallel Reservoir Simulation on Tianhe-2](https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-175602-MS)*

A parallel reservoir simulator is developed and implemented on the worldâ€™s fastest supercomputer [Tianhe-2](http://www.top500.org/system/177999). Several benchmark problems are tested to prove the robustness, efficiency and parallel scalability of the simulator. 


## [2015 SIAM Conference on CSE](https://www.siam.org/meetings/cse15/) 

<!--**Salt Lake City, UT, 03/13/2015-03/18/2015**-->

**Presentation:** *[Algebraic Multigrid Method for Implicit Smoothed Particle Hydro-
dynamics](http://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_talk.cfm?p=68015)*

The aggregation based Alegebraic multigrid (AMG) method is generalized to solve the
large-scale linear system of equations discretized from implicit SPH. Auxiliary grid
approach is used to improve the efficiency and reduce the computational complexity.

## [2014 SIAM Annual Meeting](http://www.siam.org/meetings/an14/) 

<!--**Chicago, IL, 07/07/2014-07/11/2014**-->

**Presentation:** *[A Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics Model for Electrokinetic Flows](http://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_talk.cfm?p=65272)*

A numerical scheme based on smoothed particle hydrodynamics(SPH) for solving Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations are
developed and a fasp AMG solver are developed for solving SPH discretized Poisson
equation.

## Bachelor Thesis 

**Thesis Title:**  *Parallel Algorithms for Tensor Contractions*

Several parallel algorithms are developed to accelerate the calculation of tensor contractions.
MPI implementations are also given for the contractions between two
3rd-order tensors.

## Undergraduate Research 

**Title:**  *The Application of Numerical Methods on Quantum Mechanics*

Numerical methods, especially FDM and FEM, are applied to solve the Schr&ouml;dinger
equation to search and check some phenomena in Physics.
