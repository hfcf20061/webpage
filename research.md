My research interest are iterative linear solvers and preconditioners for large scale linear systems raised from discretized PDEs. I mainly focus on the following subjects:

*  Theoretical analysis for algebraic multigrid methods (AMG).
*  Fast auxiliary space preconditioning (FASP) technique.
*  FASP preconditioners for reservoir simulation.
*  Parallel reservoir simulation.
